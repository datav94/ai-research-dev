# __Statistics__
### Basic definitions and Terminology

## _Terminology_

- __Population:__ A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analyzed
    1. finite population: example 2 million cars
    2. infinite population: example # of stars

- __Sample:__ A subset of the population we select to make the inferences on the population

- __variable:__ A variable is a charateristic of a dataset. lets assume we have a dataset of cars with data in columns mpg, hp, color, seats, fwd/rwd etc. each of these column is a variable as it can have single value(data singular) or multiple values(data plural) at a time for a given record in this case a car

- __Data(Singular):__ Example hp of a car. it can only have a single value for single car

- __Data(Plural):__ Example color of a car. A car can have more then one color for a single car

- __Experiment:__ A planned activity whose result yield a set of data

- __Parameter:__ A numerical value summarizing all the data of an entire population

- __Statistic:__ A numerical value summarizing the sample data


## _Data_

### Types of Data

- Numerical Data (Quantitative data):
    
    Made of numbers: Age, weight, number of children, shoe size etc

    - Continuous: (infinite options)
        _Example_: Age, weight, blood pressure etc

    - Discrete: (finite options) 
        _Example_: shoe size, number of children in family, # of gears in a car etc
        
- Categorical Data (Qualitative Data):

    Made of words: Eye color, gender, blood type, ethnicity etc

    - Ordinal: Data has hierarchy (data is ordered or in hierarchy)
        _Example_: Pain severity,  Satisfaction rating, mood etc

    - Nominal: Data has no hierarchy
        _Example_: Eye color, Dog breed, blood type etc
